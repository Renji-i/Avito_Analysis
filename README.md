# Avito Data Preprocessing and Analysis

This project involves the preprocessing and analysis of real estate listings data from Avito. The primary goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, and normalizing the data. Additionally, we use techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance and perform feature selection.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Real estate listings from Avito
- **Primary tasks**: 
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values)
  - Statistical analysis and descriptive statistics
  - Outlier detection
  - Normalization and standardization
  - Addressing data imbalance using SMOTE
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
